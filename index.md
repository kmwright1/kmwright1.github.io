## About Me

My name is Keanna Wright and I am a rising Junior Computer Engineering student at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University. A few organizations that I am a part of include Alpha Lambda Delta: National Society for first year success, Society of Women Engineers, and National Society of Black Engineers.

I grew up in Hampton, Virginia and have always had a passion for Computer Science and Mathematics. Having two Engineers as parents has allowed me to see the importance of STEM education. I strive to one day have a career in the STEM field where I can be creative and make a positive impact on the world.

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Dr. Monica Anderson. Dr. Anderson is an Associate Professor at the University of Alabama.
