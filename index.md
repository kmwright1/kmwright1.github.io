## About Me

My name is Keanna Wright and I am a rising Junior Computer Engineering student at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University. I plan to graduate in 2020. A few organizations that I am a part of include Alpha Lambda Delta: National Society for first year success, Society of Women Engineers, and National Society of Black Engineers.

I grew up in Hampton, Virginia and have always had a passion for Computer Science and Mathematics. Having two Engineers as parents has allowed me to see the importance of STEM education at a young age. I strive to one day have a career in the STEM field where I can be creative and make a positive impact on the world.

I am so excited about this summer DREU experience. Being able to contribute to a research project that can help others, while also expanding my learning is such an amazing opportunity.
