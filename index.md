## About Me
**Keanna Wright**

<img src="https://kmwright1.github.io/images/JOKE3874.JPG" height="165" width="140">

My name is Keanna Wright and I am a rising Junior Computer Engineering student at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University. I plan to graduate Spring semester 2022. A few organizations that I am a part of include Alpha Lambda Delta: National Society for first year success, Society of Women Engineers, and National Society of Black Engineers.

I grew up in Hampton, Virginia and have always had a passion for Computer Science and Mathematics. Having two Engineers as parents has allowed me to see the importance of STEM education at a young age. I strive to one day have a career in the STEM field where I can be creative and make a positive impact on the world.

I am so excited about this summer DREU experience. Being able to contribute to a research project that can help others, while also expanding my learning is such an amazing opportunity.

## About My Project

For my 2020 DREU Project I am creating an immersive virtual reality environment. Virtual Reality is known for being immersive and can provide a hands on learning experience. This virtual reality simulation will be used to not only help others but to also create new studies. I am using Unity to build this virtual environment. I will also be using an Oculus Quest to test out my virtual reality environment. Below I have provided a few of my project goals and a link to my final report.

**Project Goals:**
* Create plain VR Environment in Unity.
* Add static elements to the Unity scene.
* Create hands on animations.
* Make environment interactable.
* Test environment with Occulus Quest.
